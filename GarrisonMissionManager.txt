== GMM features ==
Here's the index of features of Garrison Mission Manager that are detailed below.

# Best team selection
# Mission list best teams at a glance
# Follower item level indicator
# Indicator for shipments ready to be boosted
# Mass set/remove followers to work in buildings
# LDB module

== Best team selection ==
GMM adds 3 buttons on mission page with top 3 suggestions. Clicking any of those button will set suggested team. Each button will show you success rate along with icons for XP bonus, GR bonus, and reduced time. It takes care of each and every trait and ability your followers have, present and future, including those easily forgotten "Increases success chance when on a mission with a <race>" traits, by not actually caring about them at all - it simply tries all combinations and selects those that give best total success chance. Suggestions will try to maximize success rate first, material multiplier (garrison resources) second, then XP bonus and then reduced time.

You can add followers to ignore list if you want. Select "GMM: Ignore" in right-click follower menu. Ignored follower will be dimmed with red overlay in followers list and won't be used in any calculated party.

People who love macros can access mission page buttons with:
 * /run GMM_Click("MissionPage1")
 * /run GMM_Click("MissionPage2")
 * /run GMM_Click("MissionPage3")

And Blizzard's "Start Mission" button with:
 * /run GMM_Click("StartMission")

=== GR yield mode ===
On garrison resources reward missions a second set of 3 more buttons will appear, showing best choices for GR gain - i.e. you could have lower success rate, but in long run your average GR yield will be better thanks to "Scavenger" traits.

=== Fully maxed followers ===
GMM will not suggest fully maxed teams on missions that only grant XP as long as you have unmaxed followers. If you don't have salvage yard and only have fully maxed followers GMM will not suggest teams for XP missions at all - this will be indicated by empty suggestion buttons on such missions. However when all your unmaxed are busy and if you do have salvage yard, GMM will send remaining maxed followers on those missions as well to allow you to hunt for salvage crates. This mode is indicated by salvage bag/crate icon appropriate for mission.

== Best teams at a glance in mission list  ==
GMM adds a top team button to each mission on mission list page so you can see at a glance which missions you could reliably do with your current followers. Missions that require more followers or garrison resources than you currently have will be dimmed out to let you concentrate on missions that you can do.

== Follower item level indicator ==
Seeing that all your followers are level 100 is mostly useless - what you really care about is what is their ilevel. Even Blizzard's UI shows follower ilevels on mission party screen when you add them to mission. GMM adopts those special indicators and expands them to follower portraits in all followers lists.

== Indicator for shipments ready to be boosted  ==
While on a mission screen, when you add a follower to party that could boost a ready shipment order in one of your buildings, it will be indicated by name of building and number of ready orders bellow follower's portrait.

== Mass set/remove followers to work in buildings ==
GMM adds buttons at garrison architect table that will allow you to automatically mass-assign all available workers to buildings or mass-remove them. Note that Blizzard throttles follower assignment/removal, so it could take a second or two to finish. Be sure to wait for buttons to switch states and usual follower assign/remove click sound before leaving architect table. GMM will always prefer the best follower for building - that is, with highest level available, because that influences actual yield and will not select lower level followers when higher level follower is busy. If you have several same level followers,  GMM will select free follower with lowest ilevel. Tooltips on the buttons will show which follower will be added/removed from each building. If best intended follower is not available - e.g. on the mission, it will be show in orange on assign button tooltip. Buildings that have a slot but don't have suitable followers at all will be shown in red.

== LDB module ==
If you have any display addon that supports LDB modules - e.g. Titan Panel or FuBar - GMM adds a module that for now will show list of buildings with followers both as icons on panel and tooltip similar to that on mass "Remove" button to help you quickly asses if your follower is working in those buildings that don't have readily visible indication like Lumber Mill, Garden or Mine or to remind you that some of your followers are assigned when you're hanging at mission table. The tooltip will also include list of buildings that you have no followers for in red. Note that GMM only loads on-demand with Blizzard's garrison UI, so you won't see display or even module itself listed in available modules list until you load garrison UI by interacting with any garrison facility - e.g. mission or architect table. You can also simply click "garrison report" on your minimap to load it.

GMM aims to be fast and lightweight, keeping CPU and memory use to the minimum.
