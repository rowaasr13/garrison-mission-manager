Garrison Mission Manager

This addon assists you with selecting best team for garrison missions. It adds 3 butons on mission page with top 3 suggestions. Clicking each of this button sets suggest team.

It takes care of each and every trait and ability your followers have, present and future, including those easily forgotten "Increases success chance when on a mission with a <race>" traits, but not actually caring about them at all - it simply tries all combinations and checks out those who give best total success chance.

Suggestions will try to maximize success rate first, material multiplier (garrison resources) second, then XP bonus and then reduced time.

Planned features:
 * add info about material/XP/time bonuses to buttons
 * option to risk lower chance missions with XP/material multiplier party for better average yield
 * add teams to every mission on mission list screen to let you see at a glance which missions are good for your currently available followers

Change log:

 * Initial implementation: suggestions at mission page.
