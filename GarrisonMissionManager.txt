Garrison Mission Manager

This addon assists you with selecting best team for garrison missions. It adds 3 butons on mission page with top 3 suggestions. Clicking any of those button sets suggested team.

It takes care of each and every trait and ability your followers have, present and future, including those easily forgotten "Increases success chance when on a mission with a <race>" traits, by not actually caring about them at all - it simply tries all combinations and selects those that give best total success chance.

Suggestions will try to maximize success rate first, material multiplier (garrison resources) second, then XP bonus and then reduced time.

Planned features:
 * option to risk lower chance missions with XP/material multiplier party for better average yield
 * add teams to every mission on mission list screen to let you see at a glance which missions are good for your currently available followers
 * cache results for all missions as long as follower list is unchanged to allow quick clicks around (can also be used to display above mentioned mission list buttons)
 * provide support for macroing clicks
 * add "total level of followers involved" to sort order below XP gain, lower - better

Change log:

2014-11-23 v5
 * Fix performance: stop Blizzard UI from following follower move in/out party and try to re-process/re-draw entire followers list on each. Keep in mind that 3 followers mission analyze could easy produce up to thousand moves.
