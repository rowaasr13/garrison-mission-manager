== Change log ==
2015-02-26 v23
 * TOC Interface version bump.

2015-02-18 v23
 * Fix some more minor building detection problem caused by early load and expand detection to buildings that have slots but no followers.
 * Show on assign button and LDB module tooltips buildings that have slots but no followers in red, change busy followers color to orange.

2015-02-03 v22
 * Add support for detecting buildings if some other addon (e.g. Broker Garrison) forced Blizzard's Garrison UI to start on game load. Otherwise GMM would disable features that depend on knowing what buildings you have in your garrison - i.e salvage mode and auto-assign/remove.
 * /run GMM_Click("StartMission") shortcut for macros.

2015-02-02 v21
 * LDB module to show currently working followers.
 * Fix some more auto-assign errors with incorrect detection of free or busy best follower candidates.

2015-01-22 v20
 * Fix auto-assign incorrectly prefering busy follower if it had lower ilevel and was further down in list.

2015-01-18 v19
 * Fix auto-assign button didn't noticing changes in follower status in realtime like tooltip does - it would refuse to auto-assign back followers that were working when you opened architect table.
 * When several followers of same level available to be assigned to building, select lowest ilevel among free followers.
 * Allow fully maxed teams on XP missions when player have Salvage Yard and all unmaxed followers are busy.

2015-01-12 v18
 * Fix tooltip errors on mass assign/remove buttons.

2015-01-12 v17
 * Mass assign/remove buttons on garrison architect table screen.
 * Prefer lowest level/ilevel followers among otherwise identical results.

2014-12-23 v16
 * Use special ilvl border for portrait and force abbreviated text - helps Chinese client against ilevel string overflowing out of frame.
 * Save/restore followers set in party on mission page for better compatibility with addons that pre-seed party (like MP).

2014-12-23 v15
 * Show iLevel instead of maxed level directly on follower portrait in all lists, just like it works in party on mission page.

2014-12-17 v14
 * Refresh shipment data when calculating alert about followers for orders, or it'd be stuck on info you've last seen on garrison landing page.

2014-12-16 v13
 * Detect and alert below follower's party portrait on mission page if there are orders ready in building that this follower could boost.
 * GR yield mode - add a second set of buttons with best average GR yield on relevant missions.
 * Dim missions if you don't have enough GR to start as well.

2014-12-05 v12
 * Fix forgotten settings save - ignored followers are now remembered.

2014-12-05 v11
 * Remove XP bonus icons from buttons with maxed out parties.
 * Follower ignore support.

2014-12-02 v10
 * Fix all event handling related lags.

2014-11-30 v9
 * Fix stop in mission list when you only have free maxed out followers and all missions after first XP-only reward is not calculated.

2014-11-29 v8
 * Fix dimming spilling over to active missions
 * Add global unregistering support for AceEvent-3.0. Removes lag while working with Gear Grinder and any other Ace3 addon.

2014-11-28 v7
 * Add top team to each mission on mission list screen
 * Dim missions that require more followers than you really have

2014-11-25 v6
 * Deprioritize maxed out followers on follower XP reward missions, less - better; full maxed teams completely disallowed
 * Expose support for macroing button clicks
 * Add support for unregistering events in FollowerLocationInfo addon - otherwise it'd cause GMM to lag just as Blizzard UI did

2014-11-23 v5
 * Fix performance: stop Blizzard UI from following follower move in/out party and try to re-process/re-draw entire followers list on each. Keep in mind that 3 followers mission analyze could easy produce up to thousand moves.

2014-11-23 v4
 * Fix problem with material multiplier priority/icon shown on money reward missions

2014-11-23 v3
