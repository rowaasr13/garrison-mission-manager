== Change log ==
2015-06-24 v32
 * Fix v6.2 compatibility problem that could affect users with some other addon pre-filling party before GMM's analysis.

2015-06-23 v31
 * v6.2 compatibility. Runs on both 6.2 and pre-6.2, so you can safely upgrade before maintenance.

2015-05-15 v30
 * Don't show "level 100" indicator in mission list on missions that require ilevel. Instead just show mission ilevel in same big font and with slightly brighter color to make the easier to see at a glance.
 * Always show ilevel under follower portrait regardless if mission requires it or not to make it easier to see training of followers you're about to send on mission.
 * Color maxed follower ilevel (675) in green to make it easier to see who you still need to upgrade.

2015-03-26 v29
 * Mission list now shows expiration time on all non-XP missions in lower left corner of each button.
 * Warning for follower that have matching building slot under party portrait on mission page now warns in yellow for buildings without active work orders too.
 * Clicking red button in mission list now automatically sets best party on mission page.
 * Some optimizations to try to use less important followers (i.e. leveled/traited) that could be used on other missions.
 * Copy Wowhead mission link to chat button to the left of mission name on mission page.
 * Silently skip LDB loading if no LDB is avaialble.

2015-03-06 v28
 * Gold yield mode: same as already available GR yield mode - it will prefer bigger gold bonus to any other optimizations and will risk lower chance if "Treasure Hunter" trait compensates lower success chance in the long run. Gold yield teams are shown on same set of buttons where GR yield appears on GR missions.

2015-02-28 v27
 * "Unavailable" team buttons will show non-GR boosted teams on GR reward missions too.
 * Updated follower work orders warning to 6.1 changes: it now shows when order is currently in progress and show time to next order and amount of remaining orders.
 * Some runtime/memory optimizations.

2015-02-28 v26
 * Fix team tooltips causing errors on some configurations.

2015-02-28 v25
 * New set of suggestions considering all followers, including currently unavailable.
 * Team button tooltips showing team composition and follower status on currently unavailable followers.

2015-02-26 v24
 * TOC Interface version bump.

2015-02-18 v23
 * Fix some more minor building detection problem caused by early load and expand detection to buildings that have slots but no followers.

2015-02-03 v22
 * Add support for detecting buildings if some other addon (e.g. Broker Garrison) forced Blizzard's Garrison UI to start on game load. Otherwise GMM would disable features that depend on knowing what buildings you have in your garrison - i.e salvage mode and auto-assign/remove.
 * /run GMM_Click("StartMission") shortcut for macros.

2015-02-02 v21
 * LDB module to show currently working followers.
 * Fix some more auto-assign errors with incorrect detection of free or busy best follower candidates.

2015-01-22 v20
 * Fix auto-assign incorrectly preferring busy follower if it had lower ilevel and was further down in list.

2015-01-18 v19
 * Fix auto-assign button didn't noticing changes in follower status in realtime like tooltip does - it would refuse to auto-assign back followers that were working when you opened architect table.
 * When several followers of same level available to be assigned to building, select lowest ilevel among free followers.
 * Allow fully maxed teams on XP missions when player have Salvage Yard and all unmaxed followers are busy.

2015-01-12 v18
 * Fix tooltip errors on mass assign/remove buttons.

2015-01-12 v17
 * Mass assign/remove buttons on garrison architect table screen.
 * Prefer lowest level/ilevel followers among otherwise identical results.

2014-12-23 v16
 * Use special ilvl border for portrait and force abbreviated text - helps Chinese client against ilevel string overflowing out of frame.
 * Save/restore followers set in party on mission page for better compatibility with addons that pre-seed party (like MP).

2014-12-23 v15
 * Show iLevel instead of maxed level directly on follower portrait in all lists, just like it works in party on mission page.

2014-12-17 v14
 * Refresh shipment data when calculating alert about followers for orders, or it'd be stuck on info you've last seen on garrison landing page.

2014-12-16 v13
 * Detect and alert below follower's party portrait on mission page if there are orders ready in building that this follower could boost.
 * GR yield mode - add a second set of buttons with best average GR yield on relevant missions.
 * Dim missions if you don't have enough GR to start as well.

2014-12-05 v12

2014-11-25 v6
 * Deprioritize maxed out followers on follower XP reward missions, less - better; full maxed teams completely disallowed
 * Expose support for macroing button clicks
 * Add support for unregistering events in FollowerLocationInfo addon - otherwise it'd cause GMM to lag just as Blizzard UI did

2014-11-23 v5
 * Fix performance: stop Blizzard UI from following follower move in/out party and try to re-process/re-draw entire followers list on each. Keep in mind that 3 followers mission analyze could easy produce up to thousand moves.

2014-11-23 v4
 * Fix problem with material multiplier priority/icon shown on money reward missions

2014-11-23 v3
